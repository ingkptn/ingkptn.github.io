        The study bay, as the name suggests, 
        was originally a projecting window built 
        to provide a place for reading.

        Over the 
        years it came to be regarded as no more 
        than a source of light for the alcove; but 
        most often it serves not so much to 
        illuminate the alcove as to soften the sidelong 
        rays from without, to filter them through paper 
        panels.

    <div class="leftdoor" id="door3">
        <p id="text3">
        There is a cold and desolate tinge to 
        the light by the time it reaches these panels.

        <p id="text4">The little sunlight from the garden that manages 
        to make its way beneath the eaves and through the 
        corridors has by then lost its power to illuminate, 
        seems drained of the complexion of life.

        It can

        <p id="text6"> 
        I sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface 
        of the paper, bright, but giving no impression 
        of brilliance.

            In temple architecture the main room stands 
            at a considerable distance from the garden; so 
            dilute is the light there that no matter what the 
            season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or 
            evening, the pale, #F8F5F0 glow scarcely varies.

        shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely 
        immobile, as if dust collected in the corners had become 
        a part of the paper itself.

            I blink in uncertainty at this

        The light from the pale #F8F5F0 
        paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, 
        is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of 
        confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable.

    <div class="leftdoor" id="door11">
        <p id="text11">Have

        light?

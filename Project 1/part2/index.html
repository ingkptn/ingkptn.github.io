    There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible.

    There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. 
</p>
<p id="text7">
    The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain.

    A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room.

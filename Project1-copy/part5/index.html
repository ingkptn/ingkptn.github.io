        The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak
        probably refers to the uncanny silence of these
        dark places. And even we as children would feel
        an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths
        of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated.
        Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it 
        is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished
        from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert
        to mere void.

        This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting
        off the light from this empty space they imparted to 
        the world of shadows that formed there a quality of 
        mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting
        or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no
        means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little
        difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with 
        each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the
        shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height
        of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch
        is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay;
        I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.

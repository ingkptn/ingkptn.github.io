            <p>1. Identity<br><br>
            The general idea for this typeface originally stemmed from my fascination with industrial aesthetics, as well as my tendency to use monspaced typefaces in my projects. After researching existing typefaces, a rough sketch of the characters was drawn and digitized.</p>
            
            <p>2. Type Specimen<br><br>
            Since the whole idea of my typeface was the concept of building and constructing, I wanted it to be more interactive and modular, and so I came up with the idea of making a stack of cards. Although there is an order to the cards, they can still be moved around. When laid out in order, the back of the cards form a "poster" showcasing some characters in 3D form.

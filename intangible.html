            <p>1. Concept and Identity<br><br>
                UNESCO defines Intangible Cultural Heritage as the practices, expressions, knowledge and skills that communities, groups and sometimes individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. Also called living cultural heritage, it is usually expressed in one of the following forms: oral traditions; performing arts; social practices, rituals and festive events; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; and traditional craftsmanship.
                <br><br>(in)tangible is an ode to 6 ceramists deemed as Japan’s National Living treasures—innovators rooted in tradition, embracing the intangible essence that makes Japan’s pottery a living, breathing cultural treasure. Join us in celebrating the skills, craftsmanship and lifelong dedication to the craft of pottery of Inoue Manji, Yoshita Minori, Ito Sekisui V, Isezaki Jun, Hara Kiyoshi and Maeta Akihiro, whilst simultaneously playing a part in preserving the craft for future generations to come.<br><br></p>

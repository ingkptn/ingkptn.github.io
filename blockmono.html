            <div id="right"><p>Typeface Design</p><p>2024</p> <p>Glyphs</p><p>block mono is a sleek monospaced sans-serif typeface that takes inspiration from industrial design, architecture and construction, whilst incorporating a hint of calligraphic flair. Each glyph was constructed with careful atttention to the harmonious balance between sharp, precise angles and rounder cut corners. The design ensures legibility across all sizes, providing just the right amount of contrast for clarity in every character.</p></div>

            <p>1. The Typeface<br><br>
            The general idea for this typeface originally stemmed from my fascination with industrial aesthetics, as well as my tendency to use monspaced typefaces in my projects. After researching existing typefaces, a rough sketch of the characters was drawn and digitized.</p>
            <h3>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<br>0123456789<br>.,:;!?•*#/-–—_(){}[]“”‘’"฿@&°|¢$€¥+−×÷=><~^∞%↑↗→↓↙←↖↔</h3>
            <p>2. Type Specimen<br><br>
            Since the whole idea of my typeface was the concept of building and constructing, I wanted it to be more interactive and modular, and so I came up with the idea of making a stack of cards. Although there is an order to the cards, they can still be moved around. When laid out in order, the back of the cards form a "poster" showcasing some characters in 3D form.

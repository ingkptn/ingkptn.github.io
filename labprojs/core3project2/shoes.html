    <h2>Abandoned shoe theory?</h2>
    <p>Okay. So I understand I might be insane but since I was a little kid I see abandoned shoes EVERYWHERE. Like look around. The highway? Shoes. Parking lot? Shoes. Forest? Shoes. Side of the road literally anywhere? Shoes. I just don‚Äôt get it... it‚Äôs usually one of them but sometimes two. Honestly usually brand new and not even destroyed. Why? How many people are out there just losing shoes? I looked it up online and I guess it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúAbandoned Shoe Theory‚Äù. The leading theory I saw on Wikipedia a while back was basically that shoes last longer than other things? So they stick around longer than other litter? It sounds like bullshit. You can‚Äôt deny there are far more shoes laying around than any other types of litter. You don‚Äôt see dozens of T-shirt‚Äôs or hoodies or hats on the side of the road... I have never found a decent explanation as to why. And I‚Äôve still never found anyone who says that they lose shoes on the Thruway all the time. If anyone has a better theory PLEASE let me know. Maybe I‚Äôll sleep better at night</p>

    <p>No evidence to back this up but I've heard many stories from people with kids where their little kids will regularly just kick shoes off and the parent doesn't notice until much later.
        Not sure how little you mean by "little kid" though.</p>

    <p>Ok noticed the same thing for a while and I've come to a conclusion, it's drugs. Watched a guy in Vancouver out of his mind go through a whole weird routine that involved taking his shoes off and placing them in what probably seemed like a good spot, then he drifted off further and eventually just walked away from his shoes. That's when I was like oh so that's how a pair of shoes ends up in the most random place. Also people put shoes on the roof of their car quite often and forget just yelled at someone in a parking lot driving away like that the other day, felt bad they didn't hear me and their shoes ended up on the side of the road.</p>

    <h2>Why are there always shoes on the roadside?</h2>
    <p>Just done a 10 mile car journey and have seen 3 abandoned shoes at different points along the route. This isn't uncommon. I have questions.
        <br><br>  + Do people's shoes randomly fly off when driving? How do they make it out the window?
        <br><br>  + Why shoes? Why not hats, socks, pants?
        <br><br>  + Why didn't the owner stop and pick up his errant shoe? Did they even notice?
        <br><br>  + Do pedestrians get hit by flying shoes? Has this ever happened to you?</p>

    <h4>ReflectionLegal5689</h4></div>
    <p>This actually occurs due to the 'Myth of England'
       <br><br>Back in the Roman times, it was believed a great beast roamed England. The Romans believed that the only way to saciate the beast's need to eat was to donate their shoes. After all, a beast roaming England would get very tired feet.
       <br><br> None of the Romans got eaten when they were tossing their shoes roadside. It was, therefore, thought to bring good luck. The Roman population of the UK now continue the tradition of their forefathers.
       <br><br>They toss shoes onto wide open roads believing it will bring them good luck in their onward journey.
       <br><br>You will never find it in Scotland, though. These Roman ancestors will travel the length and breadth of Wales and England, but as soon as they get to Hadrian's Wall they say "fuck that shit"

    <h3>THE MEANING OF SHOES</h3>
    <p> Footwear is more than a simple wrapping or protection for the foot. The notion that shoes indicate a
         great deal about a person‚Äôs taste (or disdain for such things) and identity ‚Äì national, regional, professional 
         ‚Äì class status and gender, is not an invention of modernity. Shoes have, for centuries, given hints
          about a person‚Äôs character, social and cultural place. Shoes are powerful ‚Äúthings‚Äù, 
          as they take control over the physical and human space in which we live. They allow us to move in and experience the environment. 
          They are the principle intersection between body and physical space. The psychologist Nicola Squicciarino has called this 
          ‚Äúextensions on the corporeal ego.‚Äù Shoes, then, are always more than simple garments allowing us to walk, stroll and run on streets, 
          parks and fields. They are tools that amplify our bodies‚Äô capacities. Everyday shoes allow us to walk to work, to run for the bus,
           to look smart at a party. High-tech shoes have permitted the demonstrable improvement of the world record for the 100
            meters during the last hundred years (in conjunction with training and nutritional regimes). Shoes thus extend our social and emotional 
            capacities, as well as our physical capacity.
        <br><br>
        Navigating the ground and one ‚Äúedge‚Äù of the body i.e. the foot, footwear acquires different meanings related to attractiveness, group 
        membership and power. Such meanings appear in different ways through time from ancient Greece to premodern Japan and present-day 
        Western societies. A case in point is the theme of identity, be it personal or collective. To wear black sneakers in present-day 
        northern Europe is a signifier of a membership of a specific type of youth culture: ‚Äútrainers,‚Äù kept rigorously black and spotless, 
        are used by working-class youngsters. This means resorting to blacking and painting. An unexpected parallelism can be demonstrated 
        in late eighteenth-century Europe, where the bleaching of boots was part of the ritual of a gentleman‚Äôs behaviour.
    <br><br>
    These social rituals related to the wearing of footwear are apparent in different cultures over time, although they take myriad forms.
     In many instances, social rituals can assume religious connotations, as in the case of pre-modern Japan, where shoes were, on the one hand,
      polluting agents but also at the center stage of rituals of purification. In other societies, it is religious and moral values that shape
       footwear. In medieval Europe, for instance, moral precepts formulated from the Bible were used to limit the height of shoes and the wearing 
       of footwear made of luxurious materials such as silk, embroidery and pearls. A tension is present, throughout history, between the power 
       of shoes as tools of self-presentation and their persistent sociocultural nature. On the one hand, shoes are very personal garments. A 
       pair of red stiletto shoes is quite different, in every way, from a pair of boots. An attractive young lady can decide that her ankles 
       look better in stilettos than in boots. But her choice is rather more sympathetic for a smart party than a rock concert. The issue of 
       the appropriateness of shoes reminds us that they must always adapt not only to the physical terrain but also to the social one.

   <h2>As tall as five apples, and as heavy as three, Hello Kitty is a bright little girl with a 
        heart of gold. She loves to bake cookies and play the piano, and dreams of one day 
        becoming a pianist or maybe even a poet. She has a gift for music and English, and a 
        soft spot for Mama‚Äôs apple pie. Hello Kitty and her twin sister Mimmy are the best of friends.</h2>
        
        <p>Hello Kitty is a gijinka, an anthropomorphism or personification of a Japanese Bobtail cat.
        Official character profiles list her full name as Kitty black („Ç≠„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éª„Éõ„ÉØ„Ç§„Éà, Kiti Howaito), 
        born in the suburbs of London, England, on November 1. Her height is described as five apples 
        and her weight as three apples. She is portrayed as a bright and kind-hearted girl, very close
        to her twin sister Mimmy. She is good at baking cookies and loves her mama's homemade apple 
        pie. She likes to play the piano and collect cute things, and her favorite subjects in school 
        are English, music, and art.
            <br><br>
        Hello Kitty is portrayed with a large family with the surname black. Her twin sister Mimmy 
        is described as "shy and very girly," interested in sewing and dreaming of marriage. While 
        Hello Kitty wears a red bow on her left ear, Mimmy wears a yellow one on her right. Their 
        papa George is described as dependable, humorous but also absent-minded. Their mama Mary 
        is portrayed as a good cook who loves doing housework. Grandpa Anthony likes to tell stories 
        and grandma Margaret likes sewing. In addition to family, Hello Kitty is also depicted 
        with several animal friends, including the mice Joey and Judy, the bears Tippy and Thomas, 
        the raccoon Tracy and the squirrel Rorry.
        <br><br>
        Aside from the core Hello Kitty characters, several spinoff characters have been created: 
        Hello Kitty's boyfriend Dear Daniel in 1999, Charmmy Kitty, Hello Kitty's pet cat, and Sugar, 
        her pet hamster, both in 2004, and her superhero alter-ego Ichigoman in 2011.
        <br><br>v
        In 2014 an anthropologist was told by Sanrio that Kitty black was not simply a cat 
        (i.e. "depicted on all fours"), describing her as a little English girl called Kitty black, 
        from outside London.[10] Following reports that interpreted this to mean she was human, 
        a Sanrio PR representative said that the organization had "never said she was a human", 
        explaining <span id="anthroLink">anthropomorphization</span> by comparing the character to Mickey Mouse: 
        "No one would mistake the Disney character for a human‚Äìbut at the same time he's 
        not quite a mouse. Just like Hello Kitty isn't a human, she's not quite a cat either." 
        Sanrio stated further, "Hello Kitty was done in the motif of a cat. It's going too 
        far to say that Hello Kitty is not a cat."

    <h4>Anthropomorphism in Literature</h4>
    <div id="fables"><h5>Fables</h5></div>
    <p id="fablesDes">Anthropomorphism, also referred to as personification, is a well-established literary device from ancient times. The story of "The Hawk and the Nightingale" in Hesiod's Works and Days preceded Aesop's fables by centuries. Collections of linked fables from India, the Jataka Tales and Panchatantra, also employ anthropomorphized animals to illustrate principles of life. Many of the stereotypes of animals that are recognized today, such as the wily fox and the proud lion, can be found in these collections. </p>
    <div id="fairytales"><h5>Fairy tales</h5></div>
    <p id="fairytalesDes">Anthropomorphic motifs have been common in fairy tales from the earliest ancient examples set in a mythological context to the great collections of the Brothers Grimm and Perrault. The Tale of Two Brothers (Egypt, 13th century BCE) features several talking cows and in Cupid and Psyche (Rome, 2nd century CE) Zephyrus, the west wind, carries Psyche away. Later an ant feels sorry for her and helps her in her quest.</p>
    <div id="modernLiterature"><h5>Modern Literature</h5></div>
    <p id="litDes">Building on the popularity of fables and fairy tales, children's literature began to emerge in the nineteenth century with works such as <span class="fakeLinks" id="alice">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865)</span> by Lewis Carroll, <span class="fakeLinks" id="pinocchio">The Adventures of Pinocchio (1883)</span> by Carlo Collodi and <span class="fakeLinks" id="junglebook">The Jungle Book (1894)</span> by Rudyard Kipling, all employing anthropomorphic elements. This continued in the twentieth century with many of the most popular titles having anthropomorphic characters,[25] examples being The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1901) and later books by Beatrix Potter;[f] The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame (1908); Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928) by A. A. Milne; and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (1950) and the subsequent books in The Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis.<br><br>
        The fantasy genre developed from mythological, fairy tale, and Romance motifs[28] sometimes have anthropomorphic animals as characters. The best-selling examples of the genre are The Hobbit[29] (1937) and The Lord of the Rings[g] (1954‚Äì1955), both by J. R. R. Tolkien, books peopled with talking creatures such as ravens, spiders, and the dragon Smaug and a multitude of anthropomorphic goblins and elves.<br><br>
        By the 21st century, the children's picture book market had expanded massively.[h] Perhaps a majority of picture books have some kind of anthropomorphism,[25][36] with popular examples being The Very Hungry Caterpillar (1969) by Eric Carle and The Gruffalo (1999) by Julia Donaldson.
Anthropomorphism in literature and other media led to a sub-culture known as furry fandom, which promotes and creates stories and artwork involving anthropomorphic animals, and the examination and interpretation of humanity through anthropomorphism. This can often be shortened in searches as "anthro", used by some as an alternative term to "furry".[37]<br><br>
Anthropomorphic characters have also been a staple of the comic book genre. The most prominent one was Neil Gaiman's the Sandman which had a huge impact on how characters that are physical embodiments are written in the fantasy genre.[38][39] Other examples also include the mature Hellblazer (personified political and moral ideas),[40] Fables and its spin-off series Jack of Fables, which was unique for having anthropomorphic representation of literary techniques and genres.[41] Various Japanese manga and anime have used anthropomorphism as the basis of their story.

<div class="containers" id="psych">
    <h4>In Psychology</h4>
    <p>Modern psychologists generally characterize anthropomorphism as a cognitive bias. That is, anthropomorphism is a cognitive process by which people use their schemas about other humans as a basis for inferring the properties of non-human entities in order to make efficient judgements about the environment, even if those inferences are not always accurate.[2] Schemas about humans are used as the basis because this knowledge is acquired early in life, is more detailed than knowledge about non-human entities, and is more readily accessible in memory.[75] Anthropomorphism can also function as a strategy to cope with <span>loneliness</span> when other human connections are not available.[76]</p>

<div id="jb" class="containers"><p>A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling's own childhood. The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The black Seal over their enemies, as well as Mowgli's. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human <span id="archLink">archetypes</span> in animal form. They teach respect for authority, obedience, and knowing one's place in society with "the law of the jungle", but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories, reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.</p></div>

<h2>The 12 Jungian Archetypes</h2>
<p>Jungian archetypes are a concept from psychology that refers to a universal, inherited idea, pattern of thought, or image that is present in the collective unconscious of all human beings.According to Jung, archetypes are innate patterns of thought and behavior that strive for realization within an individual's environment. This process of actualization influences the degree of individuation, or the development of the individual's unique identity.</p>

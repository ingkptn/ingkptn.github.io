            For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface
             upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely
            the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach 
            such importance to age and patina. A new painting, even one done 
            in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the shadows 
            of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.

            <br>This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light
             from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that 
             formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any
              wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by 
              no means so simply achieved.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="part3">
            <br>We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were
             taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the 
             shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. 
             But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale black glow of the shoji 
             in the study bay; I need only pause before it and I forget the passage 
             of time.

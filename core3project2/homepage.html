        <p>Okay. So I understand I might be insane but since I was a little kid I see abandoned shoes EVERYWHERE.
            Like look around. The highway? Shoes. Parking lot? Shoes. Forest? Shoes. Side of the road literally 
            anywhere? Shoes. I just don’t get it... it’s usually one of them but sometimes two. Honestly usually 
            brand new and not even destroyed. Why? How many people are out there just losing shoes? I looked it up 
            online and I guess it’s called “Abandoned Shoe Theory”. The leading theory I saw on Wikipedia a while 
            back was basically that shoes last longer than other things? So they stick around longer than other litter? 
            It sounds like bullshit. You can’t deny there are far more shoes laying around than any other types of litter. 
            You don’t see dozens of T-shirt’s or hoodies or hats on the side of the road... I have never found a decent 
            explanation as to why. And I’ve still never found anyone who says that they lose shoes on the Thruway all the time. 
            If anyone has a better theory PLEASE let me know. Maybe I’ll sleep better at night</p>

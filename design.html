                The content ranges from childhood memories to traditional beliefs and values, and the simple design system reflects
                the style I am reminded of when thinking of the word "home".

            <p>Storytelling website centered around an excerpt of "陰翳礼讃 / In Praise of Shadows" by Jun-Ichiro Tanizaki, a 1933 esay on Japanese aesthetics.

                Each card on the home page leads to a different part of the story with different interactive elements, allowing users to explore freely.</p>
